# Radiology Mondrian Conformal Prediction Toolkit

## Description
This repository contains a toolkit for implementing Mondrian conformal prediction (MCP) in radiological deep learning settings. While it is designed for use in medical image analysis, the creators encourage researchers and curious minds from other disciplines to apply MCP to their workflows to further investigate its potential. This toolkit is released in conjunction with the paper *Toward Clinically Trustworthy Deep Learning: Applying Conformal Prediction to Intracranial Hemorrhage Detection* from the [Mayo Clinic AI Lab)[https://mayo-radiology-informatics-lab.github.io/MIDeL/index.html].
